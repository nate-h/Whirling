My highs and lows while creating this
=====================================

What this program was supposed to be
------------------------------------

A music visualizer that's smart enough to build visuals based on what
instruments, vocals were present. Music visualizers typically operate on the
whole spectrogram of the song.

It turned into a learning opportunity with a side consequence of the goal

Opengl
------

Wrote using pygame primitives and hit speed limit
Started rewriting in opengl
Iterated several times getting stuff to run faster till I figured out how to use vbos

Creating mini-library of opengl helpers.


Spectrogram
-----------

Multi-thread or multi-processor
Log axis stuff

Tools
-----

Explain a little bit about each of these technologies
librosa
spleeter
rxpy


What I've learned
-----------------

How to set up python packages
how to operate on sound
how to use all my knowledge
more mathy stuff
Don't blame the lib or framework, blame your bad code


Viridis slowness
----------------

Had to recreate viridis because using cmaps was slow.


Failing to realize extent of project
------------------------------------

Failed to realize what I was creating and built many features to do precisely
what I needed at the time. When more was needed, I had to rebuild that feature.
